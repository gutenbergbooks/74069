MULE</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">I<br>

JUST A LITTLE JOKE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a great flurry in the farmyard.
Old dog Spot was yelping; Henrietta
Hen was clucking; Turkey Proudfoot was
gobbling; Grunty Pig was squealing.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake! What has happened?”
Miss Kitty Cat asked the old
horse Ebenezer, who stood tied to a hitching-post
near the woodshed steps.</p>

<p>Ebenezer switched his tail at a fly on
his flank before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see what Farmer Green led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
into the barn a few minutes ago?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No! What was it?” Miss Kitty answered
eagerly.</p>

<p>The old horse Ebenezer yawned, as if
there was something that made him very,
very weary.</p>

<p>“It was a most peculiar person,” he told
Miss Kitty Cat. “I made myself known
to him; and asked him his name. He said
it was ‘Mistah Mule.’ And then what do
you think he did?”</p>

<p>Miss Kitty couldn’t guess.</p>

<p>“He tried to kick me,” said old Ebenezer
in a tone of great disgust.</p>

<p>“Is he going to live here? Or is he
only a guest?” Miss Kitty Cat wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“He’s here to stay until Farmer Green
gets tired of him,” Ebenezer explained.
“The worst of it is, he’s going to have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
stall right next to mine. I know already
that I shall not enjoy having him as a
next-door neighbor.”</p>

<p>All at once there was a great commotion
in the barn. First came a thumping,
pounding noise. Then Farmer Green’s
voice rose above the racket. And next
followed an odd sound, “Hee-haw! Hee-haw!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Miss Kitty Cat cried.</p>

<p>“It’s Mistah Mule,” Ebenezer told her.
“He’s laughing. I wonder what the joke
is.”</p>

<p>At that moment old dog Spot came
scurrying out of the barn. He had his
tail tucked between his legs; and his face
wore a frightened look.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke?” the horse Ebenezer
called to him.</p>

<p>“Mistah Mule just kicked Farmer
Green,” Spot yelped. “And then Mistah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Mule laughed. Didn’t you hear him?”</p>

<p>Ebenezer nodded.</p>

<p>“Did Farmer Green laugh at the joke
too?” asked Miss Kitty Cat.</p>

<p>“He did not,” old Spot howled. “He
was so angry that he scared me; though
goodness knows I had nothing to do with
the affair. I was merely an onlooker.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you didn’t nip at Mistah
Mule’s heels?” the horse inquired.</p>

<p>“Not I!” Spot assured him. “A good
many years ago I went too near a Mule’s
heels down at the village. And I’ve never
forgotten what happened.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br>

GETTING ACQUAINTED</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Green’s</span> old horse, Ebenezer,
stood in the barn and gazed none too
pleasantly over the partition at his new
neighbor in the next stall.</p>

<p>His neighbor, Mistah Mule, cocked one
of his black ears at Ebenezer.</p>

<p>“Ole hoss,” he said with something like
a grin, “I and you is goin’ to be hitched
up together in the mornin’.”</p>

<p>This news almost took Ebenezer’s
breath away.</p>

<p>“What!” he exclaimed. “Is Farmer
Green going to work us in double harness?
I—I can hardly believe it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“That what he done told his boy,”
Mistah Mule declared. “But don’t you go
to worryin’ yourself ’bout <i>work</i>. I kin
show you plenty tricks to git outer
workin’.”</p>

<p>The old horse Ebenezer stared coldly at
Mistah Mule. Ebenezer was no shirk.
And he didn’t like the thought of being
driven with a lazy partner like this
one.</p>

<p>“Where was your home before you
came here?” he asked Mistah Mule.</p>

<p>“My real home is ’way down South,”
the newcomer informed him. “I come
North last spring. An’ I been spendin’
my time over where they buildin’ the new
railroad.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve been working on the railroad
this summer!” Ebenezer exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Not <i>workin’</i> exactly!” said Mistah
Mule. “You might say I been <i>balkin’</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“What!” Ebenezer gasped. “Are you
balky, sometimes?”</p>

<p>“I most gen’rally is,” said Mistah Mule.
And then he gave his odd laugh, “Hee-haw!
Hee-haw!”</p>

<p>“Let me give you a bit of advice,” said
the old horse, looking very solemn. “Just
forget all such tricks as balking and kicking.
You’ve come to make your home
among kind people. You’ll be well treated
here. And you ought to behave politely.
When Farmer Green asks you to work, I
hope you’ll do your best.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule threw back his head and
showed his yellow teeth in a disagreeable
grin.</p>

<p>“I has to have my fun,” he remarked.
“Sometimes I has it one way; sometimes
another.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have the best of times on this
farm,” Ebenezer advised Mistah Mule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
“if only you’ll be gentle and willing. I’ve
lived here all my life; and I couldn’t ask
for a better home. And I’ve always tried
to behave myself.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you never kick?” Mistah Mule
inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! When I’m in the pasture I
sometimes kick.”</p>

<p>“I calls that kickin’ <i>up</i>,” Mistah Mule
retorted with a snort. “What about
kickin’ <i>folks</i>?”</p>

<p>“Never! Never!” Ebenezer replied in
a shocked tone.</p>

<p>Just then a step told them that Farmer
Green had entered the barn.</p>

<p>“Just watch out, if he comes near me!”
Mistah Mule warned Ebenezer.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br>

FARMER GREEN’S TRICK</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistah Mule</span> had told the old horse,
Ebenezer, to watch out, if Farmer Green
came near him. And Ebenezer knew what
his new neighbor meant by that. He intended
to kick Farmer Green again.</p>

<p>Ebenezer soon saw that Farmer Green
had a plan in his head. He called to the
hired man. And then they both came up
with a long, stout pole, one end of which
they thrust into a front corner of Mistah
Mule’s stall. Holding the other end of the
pole, which stuck out a safe distance behind
Mistah Mule’s heels, the hired man
pushed the pole far over, crowding Mistah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Mule firmly against a side of his stall.</p>

<p>“There!” said Farmer Green. “He
can’t kick now.” And then Farmer Green
walked boldly in beside Mistah Mule and
untied his halter-strap. He backed that
black rascal out of the stall, turned him
around on the barn floor, and then backed
him in again.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule now stood facing to the
rear. He looked somewhat puzzled when
Farmer Green fastened the halter-strap
around the upright post on his left. He
looked more puzzled when Farmer Green
snapped another strap to his halter, wrapping
the end of this one securely about a
post on his right.</p>

<p>“Now,” Farmer Green remarked with
a chuckle, “we can walk past this fellow’s
stall without having to dodge his heels.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Farmer Green’s son Johnnie
had come in to watch what happened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Mistah Mule. “Won’t he bite?” he asked
his father.</p>

<p>“No!” said Farmer Green. “He’s too
wise to wear out his teeth on anything except
food.”</p>

<p>Johnnie Green then slipped in beside
Ebenezer and gave him an apple. Out of
the corner of his eye, Mistah Mule saw
Ebenezer take the gift. And when Ebenezer
began to munch the apple, Mistah
Mule spoke. “I is waitin’ for a apple,”
he remarked. But Johnnie Green went
away without giving him any.</p>

<p>“You see!” said Ebenezer to his new
neighbor. “If you had behaved yourself,
Johnnie would have treated you too.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t ’a bit him,” Mistah Mule
answered.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t trust you,” Ebenezer retorted.
“And I must say that I don’t
blame him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“It ain’t right,” Mistah Mule complained,
“to give a no-account ole hoss like
you a apple, and not give one to a valuable
young critter like my own self.”</p>

<p>“Valuable!” Ebenezer exclaimed with a
slight smile. “I hear that your former
owners <i>gave you away</i> to Farmer Green
because they couldn’t do anything with
you.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule hung his head. For once
he was silent.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br>

CROWDING THE POLE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the next day after Mistah Mule’s arrival
at Farmer Green’s place there followed
something that the old horse Ebenezer
had been dreading. Farmer Green
harnessed Mistah Mule and Ebenezer to a
strong wagon.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought not to complain, if
this helps Farmer Green,” Ebenezer
thought. “But I can’t help feeling that
he might have spared me this disgrace.
To be harnessed with a good-natured Mule
would be bad enough. But to be harnessed
with a kicking, balky fellow like this
Mistah Mule is a thousand times worse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Ebenezer sighed as Farmer Green
climbed into the wagon and picked up the
reins. But he started willingly, as he
always had, when Farmer Green spoke.</p>

<p>To Ebenezer’s surprise, his mate started
too. He had expected Mistah Mule to
balk.</p>

<p>“I see you’ve decided to behave,” Ebenezer
remarked to him.</p>

<p>“Just you wait, ole hoss, until he asks
me to draw a load,” Mistah Mule answered.
“I doesn’t mind pullin’ a empty
wagon a little ways. I likes to stretch my
legs once in a while. But I doesn’t aim to
do any reg’lar work. I never has done
any. Why should I now?”</p>

<p>On the whole, Ebenezer had little fault
to find with Mistah Mule’s behavior on
their drive. Farmer Green put no load
into the wagon. He merely jogged Mistah
Mule and Ebenezer around what everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
in Pleasant Valley knew as the
“Four-mile Square”; then drove them
home. And Mistah Mule trotted along
and stopped and started whenever Farmer
Green gave the word.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule was almost a gentleman,
except for one thing. He kept “crowding
the pole,” as Farmer Green called it. He
insisted on squeezing himself up against
the wagon-pole, which was between him
and Ebenezer. More than once Ebenezer
told him to “move over.” But Mistah
Mule might have had no ears at all, instead
of great long ones, for all he seemed to
hear.</p>

<p>This unpleasant trick annoyed Ebenezer.
But he did not let it worry him. He
had known young colts that tried it. And
Ebenezer remembered that Farmer Green
had a way of stopping it.</p>

<p>After Farmer Green had led Ebenezer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
into his stall, and backed Mistah Mule into
his, he called to the boy Johnnie: “Bring
me an old piece of leather, some long tacks,
and a hammer!”</p>

<p>When he heard that, Ebenezer pricked
up his ears.</p>

<p>“What’s this Farmer Green aimin’ to
do now?” Mistah Mule asked him.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out the next time he drives
us,” Ebenezer told him. And he would
say nothing more.</p>

MISTAH MULE’S MEALS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistah Mule</span> had a hearty appetite. And
he was not at all backward about demanding
food. Towards meal-time he would begin
to paw the floor. And though the old
horse Ebenezer told him again and again
to stop, he paid not the slightest heed.</p>

<p>“You won’t be fed any sooner for making
such a racket,” Ebenezer warned him.</p>

<p>“The longer they waits before they
feeds me, the more noise I kin make,”
Mistah Mule retorted. And Ebenezer had
to admit that that seemed to be true.</p>

<p>Now, Mistah Mule always ate all his hay—and
wanted another serving. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
wouldn’t touch the grain that Farmer
Green set before him in a box. At least, he
wouldn’t eat it. However, he stuck his
nose near it, if it was ground corn and oats,
and blew into it in a most ill-bred manner,
so that the grain flew in every direction.
Whole oats he would hardly even look at.</p>

<p>Old Ebenezer watched his neighbor’s
actions with great scorn.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” he
asked Mistah Mule at last. “Why don’t
you eat your grain?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I doesn’t care for any kind
they’s given me,” Mistah Mule explained.
“I is used to havin’ whole corn served to
me. An’ I doesn’t see why folks ’spects
me to eat what I doesn’t like. I reckon
this Farmer Green’ll learn to take a hint
before long.”</p>

<p>Well, strange to say, that very day
Mistah Mule shot a glance of triumph at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Ebenezer, because of something Farmer
Green said to the hired man.</p>

<p>“I declare,” Farmer Green exclaimed,
“I don’t see why this mule won’t eat his
grain. There can’t be anything wrong
with his teeth, for he chews his hay. The
only reason I can think of is that he has
always been fed something else; and he’s
so stubborn he won’t eat what we give
him.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he has had whole corn,” the
hired man suggested.</p>

<p>Farmer Green nodded.</p>

<p>“I’ll hitch him and Ebenezer up and
drive down to the gristmill,” he said.
“Perhaps the miller has some corn that he
hasn’t ground yet.”</p>

<p>Ebenezer chuckled when he heard that.
But he wasn’t pleased because Mistah
Mule was going to get the kind of grain he
wanted. No! Ebenezer was thinking what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
a surprise Mistah Mule was going to have
when he crowded over against the wagon-pole,
as he had when Farmer Green drove
them together the day before.</p>

<p>He hadn’t forgotten that Farmer Green
had asked Johnnie to bring him a piece of
leather, some tacks, and a hammer.</p>

SPEAKING OF HORNETS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Green</span> had started for the gristmill,
driving that ill-matched pair, rascally
Mistah Mule and the staid old horse,
Ebenezer. When they had swung into the
road in front of the farmhouse, Mistah
Mule played again that trick which had
annoyed Ebenezer the day before. Laying
his ears back, he sidled over toward
Ebenezer and pressed his flank against the
wagon-pole. He knew that the trick
bothered Ebenezer. Had not Ebenezer
ordered him, yesterday, to “move over”?
He knew that it annoyed Farmer Green
too. For Farmer Green had spoken to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
him and tried to guide him aside by pulling
on a rein.</p>

<p>Just for a moment Mistah Mule leaned
heavily against the wagon-pole. And
then he sprang away as if he had touched
a red-hot coal. He plunged wildly,
switched his tail, and threatened to kick.</p>

<p>Farmer Green tightened the reins and
called to him in a calm, firm voice,
“Steady, boy! Whoa! Whoa!”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule soon stopped his struggling.
“A whole swarm of hornets done
stung me,” he said to Ebenezer. “Didn’t
they sting you, ole hoss?”</p>

<p>“I felt nothing,” Ebenezer replied.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Mistah Mule stayed
on his own side of the road, where he belonged.
But as soon as his skin stopped
tingling he edged over toward the wagon-pole
once more.</p>

<p>The old horse Ebenezer chuckled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Mistah Mule will get stung again as
soon as he touches the pole,” he said to
himself. He wondered how many times
Mistah Mule would press against the
sharp tacks which Farmer Green had
driven through a piece of leather and then
nailed to the wagon-pole, with their ends
pointing at Mistah Mule. It was no
wonder that when they pricked him,
Mistah Mule thought they were hornets.</p>

<p>Old Ebenezer watched his team-mate
narrowly. Soon he both saw and felt
Mistah Mule lurch against the pole. No
sooner had the black rascal touched it
than he sprang away again with a grunt.</p>

<p>“Hornets agin!” he exclaimed. “Sakes
alive! I declare I never see such a powerful
lot as they is hereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Maybe if you kept away from the
wagon-pole they wouldn’t touch you,”
Ebenezer suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Shucks! What’s the pole got to do
with my bein’ stung by these here hornets?”
And Mistah Mule “crowded the
pole” again—to use Farmer Green’s
words.</p>

<p>“Ole hoss, you’re right!” he snorted as
he leaped aside. “I declare these is the
queerest hornets I ever did see.”</p>

A BALKY PARTNER</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Green</span> tied Mistah Mule and the
old horse Ebenezer to the fence beside the
gristmill and went inside the old gray
building to talk with the miller.</p>

<p>While he was gone, Mistah Mule took
great pains to keep a safe distance from
the wagon-pole. He scolded Ebenezer
when that mild fellow moved the pole even
as little as an inch toward his companion.</p>

<p>“I’se been stung three times,” Mistah
Mule grumbled. “I doesn’t care to be
stung agin.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stand perfectly still and let the
flies bite me,” Ebenezer retorted. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
have to stamp once in a while, to drive
them away.”</p>

<p>“Flies!” Mistah Mule sniffed. “I
doesn’t mind flies bitin’ me. It’s hornets
I objects to.”</p>

<p>Old Ebenezer couldn’t help thinking
what a dull fellow Mistah Mule was. It
hadn’t once occurred to him that what he
called hornet-stings was caused by the
pricks of the sharp tacks which Farmer
Green had fastened to the wagon-pole in
order to teach Mistah Mule to stay where
he belonged.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Farmer Green appeared
in the wide doorway of the gristmill,
dragging a heavy sack, which he
dropped at the threshold. Then he leaped
down upon the ground and walked toward
Mistah Mule and Ebenezer.</p>

<p>“There’s your corn that you’ve been
wanting,” Ebenezer told Mistah Mule.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
“Farmer Green is going to drive us up to
the doorway and load the sack into the
wagon.”</p>

<p>“I’se willin’ to help pull the empty
wagon across the yard,” said Mistah Mule.
“But after Farmer Green loads that
heavy sack into it, I aims to stay right
where I is.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Ebenezer. “Are you
going to balk? Aren’t you going to help
draw your own corn home to the barn?”</p>

<p>There was a very surly look in Mistah
Mule’s left eye, which was nearest Ebenezer,
as he answered, “I doesn’t crave to
do any work, even for my own self.”</p>

<p>Farmer Green now untied this strange
pair, turned them around, and backed the
wagon up to the gristmill door. Then he
dumped the sack of corn into the back of
the wagon, sat down upon the seat, picked
up the reins, and said, “Giddap!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Now, don’t be silly!” said Ebenezer to
his companion. “This load is nothing.
We’ll have it in the barn before you
know it.” And he started forward.</p>

<p>“I’se a person of my word,” Mistah
Mule declared. And planting his forefeet
firmly in front of him, he refused to budge
from that spot.</p>

A PIECE OF STRING</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old horse Ebenezer struggled forward,
trying to pull both the wagon and
his stubborn mate, Mistah Mule. But
Farmer Green soon called, “Whoa, Ebenezer!”
And then Ebenezer stood still.</p>

<p>Farmer Green sat upon the wagon-seat,
looking down at Mistah Mule, when the
miller, all white with flour, came to his
door and peered out.</p>

<p>“What! Are you still here? I thought
you had gone,” he said.</p>

<p>“This mule,” Farmer Green explained,
“likes your place so much he doesn’t want
to go home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Balky, eh?” the miller inquired with a
grin. “Well, it’s a nice day. I wish I
had nothing to do but sit out there in the
sunshine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to sit here long,” Farmer
Green replied. “Just let me have a
bit of string, please!”</p>

<p>The miller passed him a piece of the
twine that he used for tying his meal
sacks.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule paid no heed to this talk,
nor to what happened. His mind was
full of one idea. And that was that nobody
should make him stir a single step
until the sack of corn was taken out of the
wagon. With all four legs planted firmly
upon the ground, with his head hung low
and his long ears drooping, he looked very
silly, and sulky, and stubborn.</p>

<p>“Come!” Ebenezer urged him. “Don’t
make trouble for Farmer Green!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Save your breath!” Mistah Mule retorted.
“I knows what I wants to do.
An’ if they whips me, I’se a-goin’ to
kick.”</p>

<p>“My! my!” said the old horse Ebenezer
to himself. “I hope none of my
friends sees me harnessed with this terrible
person. I’m ashamed to be hitched
to the same wagon with him.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Farmer Green had jumped
out of the wagon. And now he stood at
Mistah Mule’s head. Watching, Ebenezer
saw him tie the short length of cord
tightly about Mistah Mule’s right ear.</p>

<p>“What for did he do that?” Mistah
Mule asked Ebenezer.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Ebenezer replied.
“Nothing like that ever happened to
me.”</p>

<p>“This string certainly do feel queer on
my ear,” Mistah Mule muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Then Farmer Green climbed into the
wagon again. “Giddap!” he said once
more. And this time both Ebenezer and
Mistah Mule started together. They
walked out of the gristmill yard and
trotted up the road towards home.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule had thought so much
about that string around his ear that he
had forgotten to be balky anymore!</p>

MISTAH MULE BEHAVES</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistah Mule</span> hadn’t been long at Farmer
Green’s place before he and Johnnie
Green became better acquainted. Johnnie
learned that whatever other faults Mistah
Mule might have, he didn’t bite. So Johnnie
began to bring two apples to the barn—one
for the old horse Ebenezer and one
for Mistah Mule. Facing backward in
his stall, so that his heels could do no one
any harm, Mistah Mule used to munch
the apples with a very happy look upon
his face. He seemed so friendly that
Johnnie Green began to tease his father
to let him ride Mistah Mule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>At first Farmer Green said, “No!”
But Johnnie could see no harm in asking
him the same question day after day.
Johnnie had sometimes known his father
to change his mind. And sure enough! at
last Farmer Green said, “Maybe you can
ride the mule some day. But I want to
ride him first. I want to see if he’s safe
for you.”</p>

<p>Then, instead of saying to his father,
“Will you please let me ride the mule to-day?”
Johnnie began to put this question
to him: “Won’t you ride the mule to-day,
please?”</p>

<p>It seemed to Johnnie that his father
had never been so busy. Farmer Green
now had a hundred things to do, not one
of which could wait while he saddled
Mistah Mule and rode him. But Johnnie
teased so much that Farmer Green finally
took the time to do what he asked. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
rode Mistah Mule up the road and back.</p>

<p>Somewhat to his surprise, Mistah Mule
behaved very well.</p>

<p>“He’s a fine saddle animal,” Farmer
Green told Johnnie as he jumped down
from Mistah Mule’s back. “He may
have some tricks that he didn’t try to play
on me. Ride him, if you want to. But
stay in the meadow. If he should throw
you, it wouldn’t hurt you so much to fall
on the grass as on the hard road.”</p>

<p>Johnnie Green was already shortening
the stirrup-straps. He led Mistah Mule
up beside a box, and from that he sprang
into the saddle.</p>

<p>“Take good care of our boy!” the old
horse Ebenezer warned Mistah Mule.
“Don’t you dare to hurt him!”</p>

<p>“I certainly aims to do just exactly
what he says,” Mistah Mule replied.
And then, as Johnnie drew the bridle-reins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> 
tight, Mistah Mule walked away.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” Ebenezer murmured.
“Mistah Mule surely is improving. He’s
behaving better every day. I almost
think I’m going to like him, after all.”</p>

MINDING TOO WELL</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnnie Green</span> rode Mistah Mule into
the meadow. Mistah Mule seemed to be,
as Farmer Green had said, a fine saddle
animal. He had an amble that was as
gentle as the sway of a rocking chair. His
trot didn’t jounce Johnnie a bit. He
cantered delightfully.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green was greatly pleased with
his mount. “I wish I owned him,” he
thought. “I wonder if Father would
swap him for the Muley Cow.” The
Muley Cow belonged to Johnnie Green.
She would have felt terribly if she had
known what was in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Mistah Mule soon proved himself a
good jumper. He cleared the brook easily.
And then he scrambled up the bank
and began to race down the long gentle
slope that stretched toward Cedar
Swamp.</p>

<p>Now, Johnnie Green liked to ride at a
gallop. Mistah Mule showed a burst of
speed that pleased him. But in a few moments
it seemed to Johnnie that Mistah
Mule was traveling faster with every
jump.</p>

<p>“He can’t be running away,” Johnnie
muttered, as if trying to put out of his
head any notion that Mistah Mule might
be doing that very thing. And then
Johnnie began to pull upon the reins.
“Whoa!” he cried, not meaning that he
wanted Mistah Mule to stop, but only that
he wished him to gallop more slowly.</p>

<p>Well, Mistah Mule had promised the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
old horse Ebenezer that he would do exactly
as Johnnie Green said. So now,
when his rider cried, “Whoa!” he stiffened
his legs and came down upon all
fours instantly. He stopped short. Nobody
could say that he hadn’t obeyed
Johnnie Green.</p>

<p>But Johnnie Green himself did not
stop so quickly. On he went. He shot
along Mistah Mule’s neck, slipped over
his head, in spite of a frantic clutch at
Mistah Mule’s ears, and sailed sprawling
through the air.</p>

<p>Some distance in front of Mistah Mule,
Johnnie Green struck the ground.
Though the grass was almost knee-high,
Johnnie found his landing-place far from
soft. And while he lay there, gasping for
breath, Mistah Mule suddenly turned and
trotted toward the farm buildings.</p>

<p>Johnnie struggled to his feet and ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
after him. He tried to call out to him to
stop. But not a word could he utter.</p>

<p>There was a great flurry in the farmyard
when Mistah Mule came home with
his saddle empty. Later, in the barn, the
old horse Ebenezer spoke to him very
severely. But Mistah Mule declared that
it wasn’t his fault at all that Johnnie
Green had been thrown.</p>

<p>“That boy,” he told Ebenezer, “he
done say, ‘Whoa!’ An’ I whoaed!”</p>

TROUBLESOME MR. CROW</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> they both lived on the same farm,
which belonged to Farmer Green, Mistah
Mule and the Muley Cow were not on
speaking terms. The Muley Cow had
spent years there. She had seen so many
queer strangers come and go that she paid
little heed to new arrivals unless she knew
that they were going to be what she called
“permanent,” meaning that they were
there to stay.</p>

<p>Of course she began to hear about Mistah
Mule, from the day when he kicked
Farmer Green. And she said then that
Mistah Mule wouldn’t be there long. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
had such a poor opinion of him that she
wouldn’t even turn her head to look at
the newcomer about whom all her friends
were talking.</p>

<p>“There he is! He’s the fellow that
kicked Farmer Green,” the Muley Cow’s
neighbors would tell her. And they
couldn’t understand why she wasn’t
interested.</p>

<p>At last, however, somebody said something
to the Muley Cow that made her
both think and talk of very little except
Mistah Mule. Up in the hillside pasture
old Mr. Crow settled down upon the fence
near her.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” he cried. “How are
you to-day? And how’s your cousin?”</p>

<p>“I’m quite well, thank you,” the Muley
Cow replied. “But which cousin do you
mean? You know, half the herd is related
to me. I have first cousins, second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
cousins, third cousins, fourth cousins——”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!” Mr. Crow interrupted.
“I don’t mean your <i>Cow</i> cousins. I mean
Mistah Mule.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed the Muley Cow
with an angry toss of her hornless head.
“What? Sir! How dare you call that
wretched creature my cousin?”</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow chuckled. He loved to
tease the Muley Cow.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “there’s his name.
‘Mule’ and ‘Muley’ are a good deal alike,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps! Perhaps!” spluttered the
Muley Cow. “But this Mistah Mule and
I are not the least bit alike.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said old Mr. Crow with a grin,
“there’s his tail.”</p>

<p>“What about his tail?” snapped the
Muley Cow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“It’s very much like yours,” Mr. Crow
replied. “It’s a tufted tail. It’s nothing
like the old horse Ebenezer’s tail. If Mistah
Mule’s tail isn’t the same kind as
yours, then I’m not a bird.”</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Crow had driven the
Muley Cow almost frantic.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what sort of tail Mistah
Mule has,” she declared. “He certainly
is no cousin of mine. He is not related to
me, even distantly.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not!” said Mr. Crow. “Anyhow,
I’ll see what Mistah Mule himself
says about that.”</p>

TWO BLACK RASCALS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mr. Crow was in luck. He wanted to
have a neighborly chat with Mistah Mule.
Not daring to fly inside the barn, he was
a bit puzzled as to how he could meet Mistah
Mule. And then came the good luck.
Farmer Green turned Mistah Mule into
the pasture.</p>

<p>From the top of a tall elm not far from
the cornfield Mr. Crow spied Mistah Mule
cropping grass near the pasture bars.
About half a minute later Mr. Crow
flopped down upon the topmost bar and
called, “Good morning, friend!”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule raised his head. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
never seen Mr. Crow before. But he addressed
him in a most familiar fashion.
“Howdy, Jim!” he answered.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow choked. He hated to be
called “Jim,” because it really was his
name, which he greatly disliked.</p>

<p>“Isn’t I met you before, down South?”
Mistah Mule inquired.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” Mr. Crow replied.
“I’ve been spending the winters in the
North for a good many years. I haven’t
been South since I don’t know when.
And—er—when you speak to me, or of me,
kindly omit the ‘Jim.’ Just say, ‘Mr.
Crow.’”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule nodded. “I doesn’t blame
you, not the leastest bit,” he remarked.
“I knows just how you feels.”</p>

<p>“We won’t talk about <i>that</i> any more,”
said Mr. Crow. “I came to talk about an
entirely different matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“What’s that?” Mistah Mule inquired.</p>

<p>“Your tail!” Mr. Crow explained.
“You know, it’s rather an odd one.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule was so surprised that he
turned his head and looked back at his
tail.</p>

<p>“I doesn’t see anything queer about
it,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Think hard!” Mr. Crow urged him.
“Doesn’t it remind you of other tails on
this farm?”</p>

<p>“No, sah!” Mistah Mule declared.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it occurred to you that your
tail is somewhat like a Cow’s?” Mr. Crow
went on.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule was puzzled. He even
seemed alarmed.</p>

<p>“This here is my own tail!” he cried.
“Can’t nobody say I stole it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” Mr. Crow agreed.
“I’ll explain more carefully. There’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Cow on this farm that everybody calls
‘the Muley Cow.’ Just to tease her, I
want you to pretend you’re her cousin and
that your two tails are a good deal alike.”</p>

<p>“But I isn’t got two tails!” bellowed
Mistah Mule. And again he turned his
head, as if to make sure that another tail
hadn’t crept up behind him, when he
wasn’t looking.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” Mr. Crow muttered.
“It’s hard to talk with this person.”</p>

MISTAH MULE LAUGHS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mr. Crow, at his very first meeting
with Mistah Mule, decided that he was
somewhat stupid. When Mr. Crow spoke
of the Muley Cow, and said to Mistah
Mule, “I want you to pretend that your
two tails are alike,” Mistah Mule actually
didn’t know what the old gentleman was
talking about. He actually looked around
to make sure he hadn’t two tails of his
own!</p>

<p>“Of course you haven’t two tails,” Mr.
Crow told him. “I mean, <i>yours</i> and
<i>hers</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m—yes, sah!” said Mistah Mule.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
“But how is I a-goin’ to pretend that?
If a fly lights on my back, does you ’spect
the Muley Cow a-goin’ to swish it off with
<i>her</i> tail?”</p>

<p>“No! No! Certainly not!” cried old
Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>“Yes’m—yes, sah! If a fly lights on
the Muley Cow’s back, I’se a-goin’ to
swish it off with <i>my</i> tail.”</p>

<p>“No! No! My goodness, no!” exclaimed
old Mr. Crow. “Listen to me.
I’ll explain carefully. I trust—” he
added—“I trust it’s not necessary for me
to use words of one syllable.”</p>

<p>“One which?” Mistah Mule inquired,
cocking a long ear towards Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow paid no heed to the question.
“I’ll put it this way,” he said: “I want to
have a little fun with the Muley Cow. I
want to tease her a bit. So when you meet
her—as you’re sure to, if you stay here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
on the farm—just say, ‘Good morning,
madam! I see your tail is very much like
mine.’ Now you understand, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule scratched his head with
one hind foot. Something still puzzled
him.</p>

<p>“How that a-goin’ to <i>tease</i> her?” he
asked. “’Pears to me it a-goin’ to <i>please</i>
her.”</p>

<p>“You think so?” Mr. Crow retorted
with a sly smile. “Well, perhaps you’re
right. Try it, anyhow. And let me know
what she says to you.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Crow flew away towards the
cornfield.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Mistah Mule grunted as he
watched Mr. Crow growing smaller and
smaller in the distance. “That ole rascal,
he a-tryin’ to git me into trouble. That
old Jim Crow, he think he’s mighty sly.
But I reckon maybe I kin play a trick or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
two my own self.” And Mistah Mule
laughed in his odd fashion, “Hee-haw!
Hee-haw!”</p>

<p>’Way over in the cornfield Mr. Crow
heard him. And the old gentleman
stopped right in the middle of a chuckle.</p>

<p>“I’d give an ear of corn,” he said
aloud, “to know what he’s laughing at.”</p>

OBLIGING A LADY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mr. Crow had said that the Muley
Cow and Mistah Mule were sure to meet,
if Mistah Mule stayed at Farmer Green’s
place. And they did. One day Mistah
Mule was pulling at a choice clump of
clover, in the pasture, when an elderly
dame thrust her head over the stone wall
near-by, stared at him for a few seconds,
swallowed her cud, and spoke.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” she called out. “Unless
I’m mistaken, you’re the person
they’re all talking about. You’re Mistah
Mule.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m!” Mistah Mule mumbled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Would you be so kind as to turn
around for a moment?” the old lady
asked. “I’m the Muley Cow and I’d like
to see your tail.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m!” Mistah Mule repeated, as he
wheeled about.</p>

<p>“That will do, thank you!” the Muley
Cow told him presently. “I wanted to
look at your tail. Old Mr. Crow told me
it was a good deal like my own.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m!” said Mistah Mule.</p>

<p>“So you agree with Mr. Crow!” exclaimed
the Muley Cow quickly.</p>

<p>“No’m!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear you say that,” the
Muley Cow replied. “Your tail is <i>not</i> like
mine. It has no beautiful curl dangling
at the end of it, like this one of mine.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule walked up to the stone wall
and laughed in his strange fashion.</p>

<p>“That ole Crow, he try to make trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
for me an’ you,” he informed the Muley
Cow. “He say for me to tell you our tails
is like enough to be twins. But I says,
that ole black scamp better do his errands
his own self. I has seen too many of his
folkses down South, where I comes from,
to do what he tell me. I a-goin’ do just
what he <i>don’t</i> tell me!”</p>

<p>“Well! Well!” cried the Muley Cow.
“You’re a person of some sense, after all.
You surprise me, sir. I had a very poor
opinion of you, when I heard that you
had kicked Farmer Green.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule looked very uneasy.</p>

<p>“I ain’t goin’ to do that no more,” he
said. And he hung his head.</p>

<p>“You sent Johnnie Green flying, the
first time he rode you,” the Muley Cow
went on. “I hope you won’t do that
again, either.”</p>

<p>“No’m!” Mistah Mule murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“You see, ma’am, I’se never lived ’mong
kind people before. They certainly has
treated me fine on this farm.”</p>

<p>“I’m delighted to have met you—delighted!”
cried the Muley Cow. “I shall
tell all my friends that you’re going to
be on your best behavior from this time
on.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m!” said Mistah Mule. “So long
as they doesn’t ask me to work!”</p>

<p>The Muley Cow smiled. She thought
that was just one of Mistah Mule’s jokes.</p>

TOO MANY QUESTIONS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> his favorite perch in the top of a
tall elm old Mr. Crow saw Mistah Mule
and the Muley Cow talking together. He
hurriedly gathered a dozen of his friends,
whom he found in the cornfield, and led
them in a headlong flight to the pasture.
He had promised them good sport, teasing
the Muley Cow.</p>

<p>The crew of Crows found the Muley
Cow in the shade of a maple tree, chewing
her cud.</p>

<p>“A—ahem!” said Mr. Crow to the old
dame. “Did you have a pleasant chat with
Mistah Mule?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Very!” the Muley Cow replied. “I
must say that I found Mistah Mule quite
gentlemanly, which is something I
haven’t found <i>some of my neighbors</i>.”</p>

<p>Her answer almost took Mr. Crow’s
breath away.</p>

<p>“There’s a mistake somewhere,” he
croaked, amid the loud laughter of his
friends. “I should like to know what
Mistah Mule said to you.”</p>

<p>“He said something about you, Mr.
Crow. But I’d rather not repeat it.”</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow tried to make himself
heard above the clamor of his cronies,
who were having a better time, even, than
they had expected.</p>

<p>“That Mistah Mule is two-faced,” he
declared. “I’m going straight to him
and ask him what he means by gossiping
about me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come too!” cried his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>He wished they would go away. But
they all followed him as he sailed over the
hillside and settled down beside Mistah
Mule.</p>

<p>“What did you say to the Muley Cow?”
Mr. Crow demanded fiercely of that
dusky fellow.</p>

<p>“I done told her I didn’t ’spect to work
none on this farm,” said Mistah Mule
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Ha! I can well believe that,” cried
Mr. Crow. “And what else, pray, did you
say to her?”</p>

<p>“You mean, did I done say somethin’
’bout a ole black rascal who thinks hisself
mighty smart?” Mistah Mule inquired
mildly.</p>

<p>A chorus of loud caws greeted this
question. And Mr. Crow flew into a rage.</p>

<p>“There’s no use talking with this
great clown,” he said to his friends.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
“It’s impossible to converse with him.”
And rising swiftly, Mr. Crow tore off
toward the woods. His friends followed
him, jeering boisterously. And Mistah
Mule gave voice to a loud <i>hee-haw</i>, which
only made Mr. Crow fly the faster.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule stood still and watched
his late callers straggle into the cover of
the tree-tops.</p>

<p>“I doesn’t look to see that old Crow
’round here agin in a hurry,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“I certainly hope not!” said somebody
in a squeaky tone, right at his feet.</p>

<p>“My sakes! Who’s here?” Mistah
Mule exclaimed.</p>

ALL ABOUT GHOSTS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mistah Mule heard the tiny,
squeaky voice, he didn’t know, at first,
who had spoken. He looked all around
for some moments before he spied two
beady bright eyes peeping up at him from
beneath a plantain leaf.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive!” Mistah Mule exclaimed
then. “I thought they was ghostses
’round here.”</p>

<p>“No!” said the small person who eyed
him steadily. “I am not one of those
things. I am Master Meadow Mouse.”</p>

<p>“I hearn a voice but I didn’t see nobody,”
Mistah Mule explained. “That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
the way with ghostses. An’ if you sees
’em, you doesn’t hear ’em.” He shivered
slightly as he spoke, although the weather
was by no means cold.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen one?” Master
Meadow Mouse asked him.</p>

<p>“N—no! Can’t say as I has,” answered
Mistah Mule. “But my mammy,
’way down South, she tell me all ’bout
’em.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of such things as
‘ghostses’ before,” said Master Meadow
Mouse. “But now I think I must have
heard one about a minute ago. I was
asleep over there under that bush. And
there was the queerest sound. That’s
what brought me here. I came to find out
what it was.”</p>

<p>“Was it a dreadful, hollow noise?”
Mistah Mule asked him.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Sound like somebody tormented?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!”</p>

<p>Mr. Mule nodded wisely. “It certainly
was a ghost,” he declared. “Queer I
didn’t notice it. I been right here quite
a while. Kin you make a noise like it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” Master Meadow Mouse replied.
And he gave a funny, squeaky
<i>hee-haw</i>!</p>

<p>“My goodness!” cried Mistah Mule.
“That was my own self you done hear! I
was laughin’.”</p>

<p>“You were laughing?” Master Meadow
Mouse exclaimed, as if he couldn’t
quite believe there was anybody, anywhere,
that laughed in such a terrible
fashion.</p>

<p>“Uh—huh!” said Mistah Mule. “I
done laugh at ole Jim Crow.”</p>

<p>“You must mean old Mr. Crow,” Master
Meadow Mouse observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Uh—huh!” said Mistah Mule once
more.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse knew that he
meant “Yes!”</p>

MINDING HIS MOTHER</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What’s</span> your name?” Master Meadow
Mouse asked Mistah Mule.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule told him.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you’d dare to laugh
when you’re alone,” Master Meadow
Mouse remarked.</p>

<p>“’Cause why?” inquired Mistah Mule.</p>

<p>“I should think the sound of your
laugh would scare you terribly,” Master
Meadow Mouse explained. “And how
awful, if—when you were alone—you got
to laughing and couldn’t stop!”</p>

<p>This remark so amused Mistah Mule
that he couldn’t help laughing again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
And Master Meadow Mouse promptly
tumbled right over backward. He was
sadly frightened. But he soon pulled
himself together.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” he asked, “I could
learn to make that sound? It would be
pleasant, when anybody chases you, to
turn around quickly and <i>hee-haw</i> right in
his face. It’s a fine way to frighten a
person.”</p>

<p>“Keep a-tryin’ whenever you gits a
chance,” Mistah Mule suggested.</p>

<p>Just then another little person came
creeping through the grass. It was Master
Meadow Mouse’s mother.</p>

<p>“I’ll try it on her,” Master Meadow
Mouse whispered. And scampering up
to his mother, he said in his tiny, squeaky
voice, “<i>Hee-haw!</i>”</p>

<p>“There! You’re catching cold!” his
mother exclaimed. “You sneezed. Come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
right home and drink some hot ginger
tea. You must wear your rubbers when
the dew is on the grass.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Ma! I was not sneezing.
If you don’t believe me, you can ask my
friend here,” said Master Meadow
Mouse.</p>

<p>“Friend! What friend?” his mother
replied, looking in every direction except
up. She didn’t see Mistah Mule, who
towered above her like a mountain.</p>

<p>“Him!” said Master Meadow Mouse,
pointing upward.</p>

<p>His mother raised her head. And when
she beheld Mistah Mule she gave a shrill
scream.</p>

<p>“What monster is this?” she cried.</p>

<p>“He isn’t a monster. He’s Mistah
Mule,” Master Meadow Mouse told her.</p>

<p>“Come away!” Mrs. Meadow Mouse
begged her son. “It’s not safe to be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
near him. He could swallow you and me
both at the same time.”</p>

<p>Of course Mistah Mule had never eaten
a mouse of any sort. The good lady’s
fright amused him. “<i>Hee-haw! Hee-haw!</i>”
he laughed.</p>

<p>“Run, child! Run!” Mrs. Meadow
Mouse shrieked. And gathering up her
petticoats, she dashed for the nearest tree
and squirmed her way down among the
roots, out of sight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Master Meadow Mouse began
galloping about Mistah Mule in a circle.
Watching his small new friend, Mistah
Mule slowly turned round and round
in his tracks.</p>

<p>“What for you does that?” he inquired
at last.</p>

<p>“My mother told me to run,” Master
Meadow Mouse explained. “I always try
to mind my mother.”</p>

GOING FOR A DRIVE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> on the farm agreed that Mistah
Mule was growing better natured.
Even Farmer Green had to admit that
Mistah Mule’s behavior had improved.</p>

<p>One day Johnnie Green’s father wished
to send his son to the village, on an
errand.</p>

<p>“I’m going to let you drive the mule,”
he told Johnnie. “We’ll hitch him to the
light wagon. Here’s a letter to the store-keeper.
He’ll give you a part for the
mowing-machine. Hurry right back with
it.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mistah Mule trotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
briskly out of the yard, with Johnnie
Green sitting very straight on the wagon-seat.</p>

<p>Now, in spite of his long ears and his
odd tail, Mistah Mule had a certain style
about him. For all he was lazy, when he
chose to behave himself he moved his
small, narrow feet in a smart way. And
when he trotted he raised his knees quite
high, in a fashionable manner. Moreover,
he had a sleek black coat, which glistened
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green couldn’t help feeling
rather proud as Mistah Mule went down
the road at a spanking trot.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back home long before
Father expects us,” he thought.</p>

<p>Soon Mistah Mule’s feet were thumping
over the great covered bridge that
crossed the river. And in a short time
they began to climb the long hill that rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
from the valley. Beyond this hill lay the
village.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule fell into a walk. A slow
walk it was. The sun, beating down upon
Johnnie Green’s back, felt scorching hot.
It beat down upon Mistah Mule’s back,
too. And he began to think that it would
be foolish to climb that mile-long hill
ahead of him, dragging the wagon and
Johnnie Green behind him. His head
drooped. His ears flopped back and forth
with every step. And at last he moved so
slowly that Johnnie Green spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Get along, there!” he cried, drawing
the reins tighter.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule stopped short.</p>

<p>“Giddap! Giddap!” Johnnie shouted.
“My goodness! I hope he isn’t going to
balk. Go on, there!” And he slapped
Mistah Mule with the reins.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule laid back his ears, slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
turned his head, and stared at Johnnie
Green. There was no doubt that he had
balked.</p>

<p>Johnnie didn’t know what to do. His
father was waiting for that part for the
mowing-machine. And Johnnie hadn’t
even reached the village yet.</p>

<p>He sat unhappily on the seat for a few
minutes. And then he made up his mind
that he would do something. “I’m going
to tie this old mule to a tree and walk to
the village and back,” he decided.</p>

<p>So he jumped from the wagon and
tried to lead Mistah Mule out of the road.</p>

<p>But that stubborn fellow wouldn’t stir.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX<br>

THE RACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> hours passed. And Farmer Green
began to stop his work now and then and
glance down the road.</p>

<p>“Johnnie ought to be coming along any
minute now,” he said to the hired man.</p>

<p>“He ought to, unless that mule has
taken a notion to balk,” the hired man
replied.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t think he’ll do that,” said
Farmer Green. “He hasn’t balked for a
long time.”</p>

<p>But when another hour had slipped by
and Johnnie and Mistah Mule were still
missing, Farmer Green began to feel uneasy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
So he hitched one of the bays to a
buggy. And away he went, down the
road, with old dog Spot racing along after
him.</p>

<p>Spot kept carefully out of sight, beneath
the buggy, until they reached the
bridge. Then he dashed out and begged
for a ride. He knew that he was too far
from home for Farmer Green to send him
back.</p>

<p>Farmer Green stopped the bay and told
Spot to jump up. Then they hurried on
again.</p>

<p>“There they are!” Farmer Green exclaimed
as the bay began to climb the hill.
“I was wrong. That mule can’t be
trusted. I was foolish to think he’d ever
be any good.”</p>

<p>“Just what I’ve said all the time!”
Spot barked sharply.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green heard him. He turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
around and looked down the road. Then
he stood up in the wagon, waved his hat,
and shouted.</p>

<p>And then—just because he was tired of
standing there, and just because he liked
to do what people didn’t expect—Mistah
Mule suddenly started forward. Johnnie
Green clutched at the wagon-seat to save
himself from a spill.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” he cried. But Mistah Mule
paid no heed to that order. Seizing the
bit between his teeth, he broke into a
smart trot.</p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!” Johnnie
yelled as he tugged at the reins.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! Ho!” Mistah Mule chuckled,
as he went all the faster.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Farmer Green urged the
bay up the hill. Just as they reached the
top he brought the bay’s nose even with
the rear wheels of Johnnie’s wagon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Stop him, Johnnie! Stop him!” he
called.</p>

<p>“I—I—I can’t!” Johnnie answered as
the wagon jolted over the stones.</p>

<p>Then his father tried to pass Johnnie,
hoping to head off Mistah Mule.</p>

<p>But Mistah Mule would have none of
that. He stretched his neck out and tore
down the hill like a trotter at the county
fair. In a few moments he had left the
bay and Farmer Green far behind.</p>

<p>“Huh!” he grunted. “Thinks they kin
pass me, does they?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XX<br>

THE LOAD OF HAY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Mistah Mule hadn’t at last overtaken
a load of hay in the road, there’s no telling
when he would have slackened his
pace. It wasn’t because Johnnie Green
tugged on the reins and cried, “Whoa!
Whoa!” that Mistah Mule fell into a
walk. No! It was because he wanted
some of that hay. He followed close behind
the load, reaching forward now and
then to snatch a mouthful.</p>

<p>Though Mistah Mule was enjoying
himself hugely, his driver, Johnnie Green,
was anything but happy. He felt almost
as if he were stealing hay himself. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
course, the driver ahead of him knew
nothing of what was going on behind his
back. Perched far forward on his load,
he could see neither Mistah Mule nor
Johnnie, nor even Farmer Green and the
bay, who soon caught up with the odd procession
and plodded on at its rear.</p>

<p>So they finally reached the village.
When the driver of the hay-wagon drove
upon the platform of the hay scales in
front of the village store, and stopped,
Mistah Mule stopped too.</p>

<p>Farmer Green tied the bay to a post at
the edge of the wooden sidewalk. Then
he did his errand at the store—the errand
that Johnnie Green would have done
hours before, if Mistah Mule hadn’t
balked on the hill.</p>

<p>When Farmer Green came out of the
store he looked sharply at Mistah Mule’s
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“He has lost a shoe,” he said. “I’ll
drive him to the blacksmith’s shop to have
him shod. And I’ll leave you there,
Johnnie, to come home alone later, for I
can’t wait. I ought to be in the hayfield
this very minute.”</p>

<p>When they reached the blacksmith’s
shop Mistah Mule behaved beautifully.
As he stood with his halter-strap tied to
an iron ring on the wall, nobody noticed
what he said to old dog Spot.</p>

<p>“They’s goin’ to be fun here,” Mistah
Mule remarked.</p>

<p>“You’d better be good,” the old dog
growled. “The blacksmith knows how to
handle rascals like you.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Farmer Green was talking
with the blacksmith himself.</p>

<p>“I can’t wait while you shoe my mule,”
he explained. “If you’re gentle with him
I don’t believe he’ll make any trouble.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
He kicked when I first brought him home.
But he’s well-mannered enough now—except
that he balks once in a while.”</p>

<p>Farmer Green hadn’t been gone five
minutes when Mistah Mule lashed out
with his heels and sent a tin pail crashing
against a cobweb-covered window.</p>

<p>Dodging the pail, Johnnie Green fell
into a tub of water. The blacksmith
shouted at Mistah Mule. And old dog
Spot barked noisily.</p>

<p>“A bee done ’lighted on me,” Mistah
Mule remarked with a grin.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">XXI<br>

THE BLACKSMITH WINS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> kicking the pail in the blacksmith’s
shop, Mistah Mule hung his head low,
closed his eyes, and pretended to fall
asleep.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green, dripping from his
plunge into the tub of water, when he
dodged the flying pail, looked at Mistah
Mule with great disgust. And so did old
dog Spot. And so did the blacksmith
himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t trust that fellow,” said the
blacksmith.</p>

<p>“Nor I!” old Spot barked.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule opened one eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“They’s all ’fraid of me!” he chuckled.
“This blacksmith, he better take off his
leather apron ’fore I tangle him up in it.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” old Spot demanded.</p>

<p>“Just a-talkin’ to my own self!” said
Mistah Mule. “You better run long
home, ole dog. You’s liable to git hurt if
you stays ’round here. You might git
kicked right into the fire.”</p>

<p>Old dog Spot edged away a bit and
tucked his tail between his legs. But he
didn’t intend to leave. He meant to see
everything that happened. He only
hoped Johnnie Green would be safe.</p>

<p>Suddenly the blacksmith began to whistle
a lively tune, quite as if he hadn’t a
care in the world.</p>

<p>“Bring the ropes!” he called to his
helper, who looked just as strong as the
blacksmith, even if he wasn’t so tall.</p>

<p>In a jiffy they had wrapped several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
loops of rope about Mistah Mule’s legs.
He plunged and swayed. But the more
he struggled, the tighter the blacksmith
and his helper pulled the ropes. Finally
the blacksmith untied Mistah Mule’s
halter-strap. And soon Mistah Mule
found himself lying upon the floor of the
smithy.</p>

<p>Old dog Spot began to wag his tail and
prance about Mistah Mule.</p>

<p>“Now what are you going to do?” he
yelped. “You made all those threats.
But the blacksmith is too smart for you.
He’s got you where you can’t move.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule lay quite still. His eyes
were closed. And something very like a
snore came from his soft nose. He made
no sign that he had heard what old dog
Spot said.</p>

<p>Not until four handsome new shoes
were nailed fast to Mistah Mule’s feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
did the blacksmith let him get up.</p>

<p>“I wish everybody on our farm had
been here to see you shod,” old dog Spot
told him.</p>

<p>“An’ so does I!” Mistah Mule cried.
“’Tain’t every day it takes two men an’
a boy an’ a ole dog to shoe anybody in this
smithy.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule trotted briskly home with
Johnnie Green and old dog Spot together
in the wagon. He never balked once. He
knew there ought to be a good dinner
waiting for him in the barn; and he was
hungry.</p>

TURKEY PROUDFOOT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistah Mule</span> was standing at the foot of
the lane, near the barn. Near him, Turkey
Proudfoot was strutting about, looking
for food now and then, in the mud,
and gobbling once in a while.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mistah Mule gave his odd
laugh, “<i>Hee-haw!</i>” And when he heard
it, Turkey Proudfoot began to swell up,
and dart his head toward Mistah Mule,
and raise his feet and then put them down
in the same spot. He was angry; he
thought Mistah Mule was laughing at
him. “What is there about me that
amuses you?” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Mistah Mule turned about with an air
of great surprise.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know they was anyone here,”
he replied. “I was just laughin’ at my
own thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that you
haven’t noticed me here in this lane?”
Turkey Proudfoot demanded hotly.
“Why, I was here when Farmer Green
turned you out of the barn!”</p>

<p>“I never knowed it,” Mistah Mule declared.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you haven’t heard
my gobble?” Turkey Proudfoot asked in
a loud voice. “Why, I’ve gobbled a hundred
times if I have once.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t heard you,” said Mistah Mule
with a grin.</p>

<p>Now, Turkey Proudfoot liked all the
neighbors to notice him. He wanted all
the farmyard folk to admire his walk, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
fine feathers, his hideous voice. And
when Mistah Mule told him that he hadn’t
even known he was anywhere around,
Turkey Proudfoot grew angrier than
ever. If Mistah Mule had been a person
of his own size, Turkey Proudfoot would
certainly have rushed at him, and fought
him. But Mistah Mule could have kicked
him over the fence without half trying.
And Turkey Proudfoot knew it. There
was nothing he could do except bluster.
And he could always do that without half
trying.</p>

<p>“You’ve been on this farm quite a
while now,” he gobbled loudly. “You
ought to know by this time that I’m a person
of importance. When I go out for a
stroll, all the farmyard folk turn their
heads and stare at me.”</p>

<p>“Does they?” said Mistah Mule pleasantly.
“What for does they do that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“My goodness!” Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed.
“What a dull fellow you are!
Haven’t you any eyes? Haven’t you any
ears?”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule had both eyes and ears—especially
ears. But he claimed not to
know what Turkey Proudfoot meant.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you learned yet that I’m the
ruler of the farmyard?” Turkey Proudfoot
asked him scornfully.</p>

<p>And at that, Mistah Mule gave voice to
his queer <i>hee-haw</i> once more.</p>

<p>“I was laughin’ at you that time,” he
remarked.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII<br>

A PLAN GOES WRONG</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Turkey Proudfoot</span> was terribly angry
when Mistah Mule laughed at him.</p>

<p>“Why did you do that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“’Cause you thinks you’s the boss
’round here,” said Mistah Mule. “But
you has to do just as Farmer Green tells
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’ve ever seen me
fight,” Turkey Proudfoot retorted. “I
can whip all the other gobblers on the
farm.”</p>

<p>“Maybe! Maybe!” Mistah Mule replied.
“But kin you whip Farmer
Green?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Can you?” Turkey Proudfoot asked.</p>

<p>“I kin kick him plumb across the barn
floor,” Mistah Mule chuckled. “Kin you
do that?”</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot knew that he
couldn’t. But he wouldn’t actually say so.</p>

<p>“I could make Farmer Green <i>run</i>,” he
remarked, “if only he would fight fairly.
But he won’t. He fights with a stick.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” Mistah Mule exclaimed. “Do
he?” And then Mistah Mule hung his
head in thought. Soon he raised it again,
however. And to Turkey Proudfoot he
began to say something in a low voice.
Whatever it was, Turkey Proudfoot did
not seem to think well of it. He kept gobbling
protests and crying, “No! No!
No!”</p>

<p>But in the end Mistah Mule won him
over. For Turkey Proudfoot agreed to
do what Mistah Mule suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Good!” Mistah Mule brayed. “Do
just as I tells you and you’ll make him run
sure.”</p>

<p>Then Turkey Proudfoot gave a run and
a leap and a flap of his wings, all of which
carried him to the top of the fence and
thence into the farmyard. He began to
strut back and forth between the house
and the barns, keeping a sharp eye upon
the woodshed door.</p>

<p>In a little while Farmer Green appeared
in the doorway, carrying a pail,
and started to walk to the pigpens.</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot gave a loud gobble
and rushed at him. There was no stick
anywhere in sight which Farmer Green
could snatch up. Turkey Proudfoot had
made sure of that.</p>

<p>“Go ’way, you old gobbler!” Farmer
Green shouted.</p>

<p>But Turkey Proudfoot came on and on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Farmer Green was carrying something
in his pail. It was sour milk for the pigs.
And when Turkey Proudfoot was almost
upon him, Farmer Green showered the
sour milk all over him.</p>

<p>The proud ruler of the farmyard turned
tail and ran. He looked like a white
ghost as he scuttled, dripping, around a
corner of the barn where nobody could
see him.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule had watched everything
as he stood with his head over the fence.
And he again burst into his fiendish
laughter.</p>

<p>“I reckon that ole Turkey done brag
his last brag to me,” he chuckled.</p>

<p>Later, Turkey Proudfoot warned all
the flock to have nothing to do with Mistah
Mule.</p>

<p>“He’s a trouble-maker,” declared Turkey
Proudfoot.</p>

THE UMBRELLA</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnnie Green</span> wanted to go over the hill
to play with a friend—a boy called
“Red.”</p>

<p>“You may go,” his mother said, “but
you must take an umbrella. We’re going
to have rain.”</p>

<p>Now, Johnnie Green didn’t like to
carry an umbrella.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s going to rain,” he
grumbled. “I’ll ask Father if I need to
take one.”</p>

<p>“Your father has gone to the village,”
Mrs. Green told him. “Maybe you’d
rather stay at home, anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Oh, no!” Johnnie exclaimed quickly.
And snatching up his umbrella, he slipped
out of the door.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to walk ’way over the
hill—not if I have to carry this umbrella,”
he muttered as soon as he was out
of his mother’s hearing.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was throwing
his saddle on Mistah Mule. And then he
mounted him.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule cocked his eye at the
closed umbrella in Johnnie Green’s hand.</p>

<p>“What for this boy got that club?” he
asked himself. “He better not hit me
with it.”</p>

<p>Once in the road, Johnnie urged Mistah
Mule into a canter. He noticed that dark
clouds were fast gathering overhead. And
white wisps of cloud were beginning to
whisk over the top of Blue Mountain.</p>

<p>“Giddap! Giddap!” he cried to Mistah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Mule. “We want to get to Red’s house
before the storm breaks.”</p>

<p>They weren’t half way up the long hill
when the wind began to whip the tree-tops
and a driving rain swept across the valley,
pelting them with great drops.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green fumbled with the strap
of his umbrella. And then he raised it,
spread, over his head.</p>

<p>All at once a cyclone seemed to strike
him. Mistah Mule plunged and reared
and bucked. Johnnie clung to the umbrella
with one hand, to the pommel of the
saddle with the other. The umbrella
turned wrong side out at the very moment
when the saddle-girth broke. And the
next thing Johnnie Green knew, he found
himself sitting in the middle of the road,
in a puddle, holding the wrecked umbrella
aloft.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule was standing a little distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
away with his back to the storm,
hunched up, and with his head drooping.</p>

<p>Johnnie didn’t care to mount him
again. With the soft mud sucking at his
feet with every step he took, he led Mistah
Mule home.</p>

<p>“There was a cyclone for a few moments,”
he told the family while he dried
himself in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Farmer Green had come home. And
when he heard all of Johnnie’s story he
quickly guessed the truth of the matter.
Mistah Mule liked umbrellas even less
than Johnnie Green.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXV<br>

BRIGHT AND BROAD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistah Mule</span> was in the back pasture.
The only other farm folk there were Farmer
Green’s oxen, Bright and Broad.
They were a slow-going pair. They always
took plenty of time for anything
they did. They walked slowly, they
lay down and got up slowly, they ate
slowly, they thought slowly, they talked
slowly. And when they spoke, usually
they both said the same thing at the same
time, in a sort of deep-toned chant.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule was not pleased with his
companions. He thought that Bright and
Broad were dull company. However, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
had to talk with somebody, for he dearly
loved to wrangle. So he stayed near
Bright and Broad a good deal of the time.</p>

<p>Now, Bright and Broad were far from
ashamed of being slow. On the contrary,
they prided themselves on their slowness.</p>

<p>“‘Slow but sure’ is our motto,” they remarked
to Mistah Mule, speaking together
and wagging their great heads in
exactly the same, slow fashion.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Mistah Mule, who—when
he wasn’t ill—was always ready to
disagree with anybody, about anything.
“You-all ain’t so slow as what I is.”</p>

<p>Bright and Broad looked at each other
and shook their heads. Then they burst
into a rumbling laugh: “Ho! Ho! Ho!”</p>

<p>“What for you scoffin’ at me?” Mistah
Mule demanded.</p>

<p>“We’ve seen you run,” they told him.
“You’re fast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Prehaps! Prehaps!” Mistah Mule admitted.
“But I kin be so slow, when I
<i>wants</i> to be, that I doesn’t move a-tall.”</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! Ho!” Again the great sides
of Bright and Broad heaved with laughter.
“We know you’re sometimes balky.
But it’s easy to balk. A rock or a tree
can do that. The question is, <i>how slowly
can you walk and not come to a halt</i>?”</p>

<p>“Slower’n what you-all kin!” Mistah
Mule retorted.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! Ho! Pardon us! But we
don’t think so,” Bright and Broad replied.
Bright winked very slowly at
Broad; and Broad winked very slowly at
Bright.</p>

<p>Now, Mistah Mule was all for settling
the dispute by talk. But Bright and
Broad told him that all the talking in the
world couldn’t convince them that they
were wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“There’s just one way to end the argument,”
they told Mistah Mule. “And
that is to have a slow race.”</p>

<p>Although Mistah Mule didn’t know
what they meant, he exclaimed that he was
ready for anything.</p>

<p>“I doesn’t keer,” he said, “what kind o’
race it is. I knows I kin win it.”</p>

A QUEER KIND OF RACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bright</span> and Broad, the oxen, were going
to race against Mistah Mule in the back
pasture.</p>

<p>It was going to be a slow race.
And since Mistah Mule hadn’t the slightest
idea what a slow race was, Bright and
Broad started to explain. As usual, they
both began to speak the same words, at the
same time.</p>

<p>“The race,” they told Mistah Mule,
“will be from the fence here to the big
pine tree on the other side of the pasture.
We two will keep together, just as we always
do. We’ll all three start at once.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
If you reach the pine tree first, you lose.
If we reach it first, we lose.”</p>

<p>“Don’t nobody win this race?” Mistah
Mule inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! Whoever reaches the pine
tree last will win.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s one agin two,” he complained.
“Don’t ’pear like it’s a fair race. If one
o’ you go too fast, the other kin hold him
back.”</p>

<p>Bright and Broad swung their heads
around and looked at each other again.</p>

<p>“What do you suggest?” Broad inquired
of Bright and Bright inquired of
Broad.</p>

<p>“Why not let him walk behind us?”
each replied to the other.</p>

<p>“’Cause why?” Mistah Mule broke in.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see? It will be more than
fair to you,” they explained. “So long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
as you keep behind us, you’ll know that
you aren’t going to reach the pine tree
until after we get there. Only, of course,
you mustn’t stop walking. If you find
you can’t walk slowly enough, just swerve
aside and pass us.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule quickly agreed to this
plan. He couldn’t see, now, how he could
possibly lose the race.</p>

<p>“I hopes—” he remarked, as he took his
place behind the oxen—“I hopes you-all
doesn’t kick.”</p>

<p>“Never!” they assured him. And each
whispered to the other, “That’s more than
he can say about himself.”</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” Bright and Broad
then boomed in their deep tones.</p>

<p>“Yes, sah! Yes, sah!” Mistah Mule replied.
He answered twice, because he was
talking to them both, and he wanted to be
polite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Go!” they bellowed. And each began
very slowly to lift a foot off the ground.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule suddenly forgot that this
was to be a <i>slow</i> race. When he heard
the word “Go!” he gave a great leap,
which carried him between Bright and
Broad and thrust those heavy fellows
rudely apart.</p>

<p>“Whoa, there!” they both cried. “Get
back! If you must pass, go around us.”</p>

A GOOD RACE SPOILED</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> slow race across the back pasture had
to be begun all over again. At the word
“Go!” Mistah Mule had forgotten that it
wasn’t a <i>fast</i> race. And he had plunged
forward before he knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>After the second start he fell in behind
the plodding oxen, Bright and Broad.
But he soon found that he couldn’t walk
as slowly as they could. First his nose
nudged Bright. Then his nose nudged
Broad.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” they both cried.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me!” said Mistah Mule.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
“Move a little spryer—can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ha!” they chuckled. “We knew we
could beat you at this game.” They
crowded against each other, so that Mistah
Mule couldn’t wedge himself between
them. And there was nothing he could
do except thrust his head and neck alongside
one of the pair. He chose Bright’s
side.</p>

<p>Mistah Mule hadn’t taken six steps in
this position when he gave a loud snort.
And then he flashed past Bright and
Broad so quickly that they looked as if
they were moving backward.</p>

<p>“A bear!” Mistah Mule brayed. “Run!
Run!”</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! Ho!” laughed Bright and
Broad. “See him run! This is just a
trick. He knows he can’t win the slow
race fairly, so he’s trying to get us to run
ahead of him.” They nodded wisely as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
they trudged towards the big pine tree,
which marked the end of the race.</p>

<p>And then—all at once they sniffed, and
asked each other a question: “Do you
notice a queer scent?” And like one ox
they both looked around.</p>

<p>“A bear!” they both roared. And
breaking into a lumbering gallop, they
hurried after Mistah Mule, who was already
nearing the fence on the other side
of the pasture.</p>

<p>Quite breathless they reached the fence
at last. But they were too heavy and
clumsy to jump over it, as Mistah Mule
had already done. Instead, they crashed
their huge bodies against the fence and
sent the rails flying. Through the great
gap that they had made they dashed side
by side. And they never stopped running
until they reached the barn at the foot of
the lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Mistah Mule was waiting for them
there.</p>

<p>“Somebody done win a race!” he
brayed loudly.</p>

<p>Broad and Bright shot a glance of surprise
at each other.</p>

<p>“But you ran much faster than we
did!” they cried. “You can’t have won.”</p>

<p>“I isn’t said I winned it,” Mistah Mule
retorted.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>we</i> certainly didn’t,” that honest
pair insisted. “We didn’t even finish the
race. We didn’t go near the pine tree.”</p>

<p>Mistah Mule laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>“Mistah Bear, he done win,” said Mistah
Mule. “I looks back just once. An’
there he am, right under the big pine his
own self.”</p>

UNEXPECTED HELP</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Green</span> had just had the bad luck
to have a loaded wagon sink hub-deep in
a boggy place in the meadow, near the
barnyard. The pair of bays were harnessed
to the wagon. And they couldn’t—or
wouldn’t—pull
it out of the mire.</p>

<p>Farmer Green walked to the horse-barn,
where his son Johnnie and the hired
man were working.</p>

<p>“The load is stuck fast in the mud,” he
told them. “If Bright and Broad weren’t
’way up in the back pasture they’d pull
the wagon out. But it would take a good
hour to drive them down here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>The oxen, Bright and Broad, were a
famous pair. They were wonderfully
strong—and wonderfully slow, too.</p>

<p>“There’s old Ebenezer. You might
hitch him in front of the bays,” the hired
man suggested.</p>

<p>Farmer Green shook his head.</p>

<p>“The old horse would pull until he
dropped. I’m afraid he might hurt himself,”
he replied.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you use the mule?” cried
Johnnie Green.</p>

<p>“I could <i>try</i> him, I suppose,” said his
father. “But I’m almost certain he
wouldn’t pull an ounce.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do try him, Pa!” Johnnie Green
begged. When he wasn’t driving Mistah
Mule himself, Johnnie liked to see that
stubborn fellow balk.</p>

<p>Both the old horse Ebenezer and Mistah
Mule, who stood side by side in the barn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
pricked up their ears and listened to all
this talk.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Mistah Mule grunted, as he
cocked an eye at his neighbor. “They
needn’t think I’se a-goin’ to hurt myself
a-pullin’ on their ole wagon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you the least bit,” the
old horse Ebenezer told him. “To be
sure, you’re a stout chap. Maybe you
could yank the wagon out of the hole—if
the bays would pull too—without much
trouble. But why should you do that?”</p>

<p>It amazed Mistah Mule to hear such
advice from old Ebenezer. And a very
stubborn look came over his face.</p>

<p>“I could twitch that wagon out quick—if
I wanted to,” he declared.</p>

<p>“But you don’t want to,” said Ebenezer.
“If you tried—and failed——”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me, ole hoss!” snapped
Mistah Mule. “You got ’nuff to ’tend to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
if you only minds your own bus’ness.”</p>

<p>Old Ebenezer said no more. But he
chuckled to himself when Farmer Green
came and led Mistah Mule away.</p>

<p>He chuckled again when Mistah Mule
came back a little later, holding his head
very high.</p>

<p>“I showed ’em!” Mistah Mule brayed
loudly. “I done pulled the load an’ those
no-account bays too.”</p>

<p>Farmer Green told the hired man he
was never so surprised in his life.</p>
